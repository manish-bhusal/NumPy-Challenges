# NumPy-Challenges

# Introduction
This repository contains 10 challenges related to working with arrays and 
matrices in Python. Each challenge includes a question and a corresponding 
Jupyter notebook file that includes the solution. The challenges are designed 
to help users improve their understanding of array and matrix manipulation in Python.

# Challenges
1. Create a 1-D array of integers from 0 to 9 and then reverse it.
2. Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8 and find the determinant of the matrix.
3. Create a 5x5 matrix with random values between 0 and 1, and then find the minimum and maximum values of the matrix.
4. Create a 4x4 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 15 and reshape it to a 2x8 matrix.
5. Create a 1-D array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100, and then find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the array.
6. Create a 2-D array with values ranging from 0 to 8 and extract the second and third rows of the array.
7. Create a 2-D array with values ranging from 0 to 15 and extract every other element of the array using slicing.
8. Create a 2-D array with values ranging from 0 to 15 and divide each element of the array by 2.
9. Create a 2-D array with values ranging from 0 to 15 and find the sum of all the elements of the array.
10. Create a 2-D array with values ranging from 0 to 15 and find the transpose of the array.
